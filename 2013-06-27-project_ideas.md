## Poll: Raise your hand if *you* like creating useful software <i class="icon-hand-up"></i>


<div style="height:40em"></div>

## Project: rite a Sage thematic tutorial for the inverse problems REU

**Tasks include:**

 - Graph theory, in particular, circular planar graphs, etc.

 - Matrix algebra (?)

 - Differential equations (?)

 - This could be a thematic tutorial listed here: <http://sagemath.org/help.html>

**Skills required:** basic knowledge of Sage

<div style="height:40em"></div>
## Project: Greatly improve the $\LaTeX$ editor in cloud.sagemath

**Tasks include:**

 - Learn all the other online LaTeX editors, and see what features they have: <https://www.writelatex.com/>, etc.

 - Make the preview more configurable (e.g., colors, resolution control, side-by-side preview).

 - Make rendering more efficient (only generate pages near the one being viewed in some cases?)

 - Inverse search: click on preview and go to that point in LaTeX document

 - Forward search: click button in text file and go to that point in preview

 - Much better display of LaTeX error messages

 - PDF annotation: ability to write notes on pdf files

 - Sagetex: automatically run sage when processing document

 - Awareness of multi-file documents

**Skills required:** basic knowledge of LaTeX, command line Linux, and maybe some web development skills

## Project: Interactive graph interface

**Tasks include:**

 - Display graphs using the [d3 library](d3js.org)

 - Ability to select graphs from graphs.[tab]

 - Display in various ways, e.g., ask for a planar embedding, circular planar embedding (with given boundary), etc.,

 - Interactively add and delete vertices (d3 already does this)

 - Ability to calculate anything about a graph using Sage on the backend via GUI

 - Calculate a bunch of nicely displayed summary information about the graph

 - A souped up, more mathematically aware, successor to <http://radokirov.com/graph-editor.js/>

 - There could also be a similar project for display of general 2d plots using d3 instead of matplotlib.

**Skills required:** Python (Sage), Javascript (learn D3)

## Create a large database of mathematical "stuff"

**Tasks include:**

 - Surf the web, interview mathematicians, etc., and come up with a list of data that would be nice to have in one database (e.g., <http://www.lmfdb.org/>, <http://oeis.org/>, <http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/ftp/data/>).

 - Import data into a very scalable distributed [Cassandra database](http://www.datastax.com/), which I would set this up.

 - Make data easy to access, e.g., through a Python API.

 - Make data *very* easy to access graphically, e.g., through worksheets in <https://cloud.sagemath.com>.

 - Do not worry too much about correctness of data; just cite exactly where it came from and when.

## Other ideas?

**What do you wish the Sagemath cloud site could do?**

(make a list -- commment on potential of project ideas)
